# Description

The scene shows utensils for a tea gathering (also known as tea ceremony) lying on a table. The utensils are: tea bowl *chawan* filled with matcha tea, bamboo tea whisk *chasen*, calligraphy scroll, tray with traditional *wagashi* candy and a spoon - traditionally a tea scoop *chashaku* is used but the spoon's shape creates more visually pleasing composition here.

**Sample photos with the tea utensils and candy for reference:**\
